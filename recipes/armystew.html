        <h4> Some Facts About Army Stew (Budae Jjigae)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Army stew or army base stew (budae Jjigae is Korean fusion stew
                    that incorportates American style processed food such as spam,
                    sausages, canned baked beans and sliced cheese.</li>
                <li>Budae is a general term for a military base in Korean and Jjigae is a term for 
                    soup/stew. Hence the word army stew or army base stew was born.</li>
                <li>Soon after the Korean war (in the early 1950's), food was extremely
                    scarce in Korea, so those surplus processed foods from the US military bases were a great
                    supplement for Koreans.</li>
